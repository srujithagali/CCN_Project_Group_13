# Project Introduction: Image-Driven Talking Head
Image-based talking head systems can synthesize realistic facial expressions accompanying speech and control tags of facial expressions. This project mainly focuses on the image-driven talking head for facial expressions. All the existing models focus on 2D representations learned from input images. We mainly focus on 3D facial geometry, which will benefit us in generating 3D face structures and avoiding noisy backgrounds and also focuses on developing a realistic talking head video of a person, cartoon, etc., from a source of the image of that person or video of another person. In the real-world scenario, this will benefit in making animation for video games, virtual meetings.
        
# Architecture:
  we intend use Web-RTC to implement client-server architecture.
  
# Project Plan
Iteration 1
The first iteration (first part of deployment) setting up the infrastructure for the talking head system. This involves selecting an appropriate cloud provider or server for hosting the system (we plan on using web-RTC), setting up the necessary software and hardware components. This include configuring the network settings. This part of deployment is important for ensuring that the project is reliable and scalable.

Iteration 2
The second iteration involves deploying the trained machine learning model that powers the talking head system. This may involve configuring the model for deployment, selecting an appropriate framework or library for serving the model, and integrating the model with the system. this step works as a testing deployment to find out whether all the GUI is working fine or not.

Iteration 3
The third iteration involves developing a user interface for the talking head system and integrating it with other systems or applications. this part is used to connect the system with a web based interface or any application for usage.

Iteration 4
the fourth iteration include deploying the system completely and testing whether the system is working as expected. find out any mistakes or errors and rectify them

Iteration 5 (Final Iteration)
This is the final step of the project. this including preparing the project report for the deployment and wrapping up everything and submitting it with all necessary files
