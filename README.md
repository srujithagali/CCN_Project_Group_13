# CCN_Project_Group_13
As I can’t upload 350 mb file in github, I am pasting the link of google drive to download the project.
Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Hg8gJ3OpBB3lh3bkIAvGwZniarinNkv/view?usp=share_link


Steps to follow:
1.	Download zip file from google drive and extract them
2.	Set the path to the folder in terminal and start downloading python 3.9
3.	Navigate to face alignment folder
4.	Then import all libraries in requirements.txt file.
5.	Try running the project. There will be some issues with the libraries. So imort all the extra libraries like pytorch, flask and tkinter, etc…
6.	As I already integrated the trained check points, you can directly run the project using “vig.py” python file and the project starts running and the web interface pops up.
7.	Upload the image and video from the folder given and the output will be playing in vlc media player.

****Nvidia is mandatory as CUDA libraries are used in this model****
