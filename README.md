# Project Introduction: Image-Driven Talking Head
        Image-based talking head systems can synthesize realistic facial expressions accompanying speech and control tags of facial expressions. This project mainly focuses on the image-driven talking head for facial expressions. All the existing models focus on 2D representations learned from input images. We mainly focus on 3D facial geometry, which will benefit us in generating 3D face structures and avoiding noisy backgrounds and also focuses on developing a realistic talking head video of a person, cartoon, etc., from a source of the image of that person or video of another person. In the real-world scenario, this will benefit in making animation for video games, virtual meetings.
